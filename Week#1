1. Name the four panels in R Studio and offer a brief description of each.
Upper-left panel is the R Markdown file, where we want to save our code.
The upper-right panel is the global environment, which contains variables, datasets, vectors, and functions.
The lower-left panel is the console, where R runs the code, shows errors, and holds code that you want to test but are not ready to input to the markdown file.
The lower-right panel is kind of a catch-all for plots, packages, and files to install and update.

2. Create a code chunk. Write your favorite number in it. 
```{r}
37
```


3. Add thirty-seven to six
```{r}
6+37
```


4. evaluate the following: six times four is equal to twenty-four
```{r}
6*4==24
```

5. What's the difference between an "and" and an "or" statement? 
In an AND statement, both sides of the equation need to be equal in order for R to recognize it as TRUE.
In an OR statement, only one side of the equation needs to be equal for it to be TRUE.

6. Create an "and" statement for the following sentence: three is less than five and tree is the same as oak. 
```{r}
3>5 & "tree"=="oak"
```


7. Create a variable called "dinner" that contains your favorite thing to eat for dinner. 
```{r}
dinner<- "salmon"
```


8. write out all numbers between 50 and 200
```{r}
seq(50,200)
```


9. print every odd number between 1 and 300. 
```{r}
seq(1, 300, 2)
```


10. repeat the phrase "i'm excited for fall" five times
```{r}
rep("i'm excited for fall", 5)
```
